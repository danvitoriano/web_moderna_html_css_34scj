*Web Moderna HTML + CSS 34SCJ*


*Project description*



For this project, your task is to take the content to the home page of a bird watching website and add structural elements to it so that you can have a page layout applied to it. Need to have:


1) A header covering the entire width of the website containing the main title of the page, the website logo and the navigation menu. The title and logo appear side by side when      the style is applied and navigation appears below those two items.
2) A main content area containing two columns - a main block to contain the welcome text and a sidebar to contain thumbnails of images.
3) A footer containing copyright and credit information.



You need to add a suitable wrapper for:
1) The header
2) The navigation menu
3) The main content
4) The welcome text
5) The image sidebar
6) The footer



*You should also:*
Apply the CSS provided to the page, adding another element just below the existing one, provided at the beginning.




*Tips and Hints Section:*

1) Use the W3C Nu HTML Checker(https://validator.w3.org/nu/) to detect unintended errors in your HTML, CSS and SVG - errors that you may have missed otherwise - so that you can    correct them.
2) You do not need to know any CSS to make this assessment; you just need to place the supplied CSS inside an HTML element.
3) The provided CSS is designed so that when the correct structural elements are added to the markup, they appear in green on the rendered page.
4) If you're getting stuck and can't see which elements to place where, it usually helps to draw a simple block diagram of the page layout, and write in the elements that you      think should involve each block.
